# Run an Existing Example

The Supabase team has provided us with a number of prebuilt [examples](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/examples#official-examples) show casing different features of Supabase. We will be using the Realtime Chat application with React to get Started.

## Realtime Chat

1. Clone the repository 
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/shwosner/realtime-chat-supabase-react.git
  ```
2. Open it in your favorite code editor. I am using VS Code.
  ```
  code realtime-chat-supabase-react
  ```
3. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
4. Replace `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` with `anon key` and `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` with `API URL`
5. Run `npm install` do download dependencies.
6. In the Supabase studio in your project go to the `table editor` and create a new table called `messages` with the following columns:

  | Field            | Type      |
  | ---------------- | --------- |
  | id               | BIGINT    |
  | username         | VARCHAR   |
  | text             | TEXT      |
  | country          | VARCHAR   |
  | is_authenticated | BOOLEAN   |
  | timestamp        | timestamp |

Alternatively, you can use the `sql editor` to create the table with following schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE messages (
    id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR,
    is_authenticated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    timestamp timestamp default now() NOT NULL
  );
  ```
7. Run the project
   ```
   npm start
   ```
8. This will start the project at port `3000`.

## Making it realtime
1. Right now the application is working but it is not real time. You can only see the new message by refreshing the page. This is because by default realtime is disabled for better performance and security. To enable realtime
   1.  Go to Database > Replication in the Supabase Studio. 
   2.  Click on Table under source at the right side of the screen.
    ![enable realtime](/img/enable-realtime.png)
   3. Toggle the table you want to enable realtime for. In this case we enable `messages`. 
2. Now if we refresh the page and send a new message we should see them show up realtime.
